Ciscord: A Discord Clone Project üñ•Ô∏è
=====================================

### Welcome to Ciscord üéâ

Ciscord is a Discord clone project built with Next.js and Shadcn UI. This project aims to provide a solid foundation for building a scalable and maintainable Discord-like application.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Ciscord, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ciscord.git`
2. **Install Node modules**: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. **Run the development server**: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### üé® Shadcn UI Configuration

This project uses Shadcn UI, a popular UI kit for building Next.js applications. The project is configured to use the **Stone** and **Default** themes, which were selected during the Shadcn UI initialization process.

### üóÑÔ∏è Prisma & NeonDB Integration

Ciscord uses **Prisma ORM** integrated with **NeonDB** for database management. The Prisma schema is designed to handle the core functionalities of a Discord-like application, including models for **Profile**, **Server**, **Member**, and **Channel**.

### üîí Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to store sensitive information, such as **Clerk secret keys** and **database connection strings**. To set up your environment variables:

1. Create a new file named **`.env`** in the root of your project.
2. Add your Clerk secret key, NeonDB connection string, and other environment variables to the **`.env`** file, following the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`.
3. Ensure that **`.env`** is added to your **`.gitignore`** file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to your repository.

### üåü Features

* **Organized code structure** for cleanliness and maintainability.
* **Clerk authentication** integrated for secure user sign-up and sign-in.
* **NeonDB database integration** with Prisma for managing user profiles, servers, members, and channels.
* **Open Sans font** used in the main RootLayout for a modern and clean design.
* **Form handling** using Shadcn's form libraries, with validation and submission logic encapsulated in Initial-Modals.tsx.
* **Environment variables** managed securely in a **`.env`** file, with sensitive data excluded from version control.

  This project was inspired by [Fullstack Discord Clone: Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, MySQL | Full Course 2023]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID](https://youtu.be/ZbX4Ok9YX94?si=40HAIuTL2TLMvi8F)). I'd like to give credit to the original creator ( Code With Antonio ) for providing a great starting point for this project.
